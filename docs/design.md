# pgl_validate — Cross-Node Data Validation for pglogical (and Logical Replication)

## Complete Technical Design Document

**Status:** Proposed (v4 — supersedes v1/v2/v3; see the version note. v4 makes barrier convergence edge-specific and exact, fixes the `row_digest` signature, gates approximate filters, and adds a validation-strength matrix.)
**Component:** `pgl_validate` — a standalone PostgreSQL extension (Rust / [pgrx](https://github.com/pgcentralfoundation/pgrx))
**Targets:** PostgreSQL 15, 16, 17, 18
**Primary use case:** pglogical bidirectional (multi-master) replication. Native logical replication and physical standbys are designed as explicit secondary modes.

> ### What changed in v4 (third review response)
> 1. **Barrier convergence is exact and edge-specific.** v3 waited for `origin_progress ≥ pg_current_wal_lsn()` captured *after* the barrier — an over-estimate under concurrent WAL that origin progress may never hit. v4 captures the barrier's **exact** end LSN `L_b` (`last_commit_lsn()` = `XactLastCommitEnd`) and makes `pg_replication_origin_progress(origin(O→T)) ≥ L_b` the **authoritative** convergence condition; barrier-token visibility is a corroborating liveness check only (token-alone is unsound in `forward_origins = {all}` cascades). `wait_slot_confirm_lsn(slot, L_b)` is called with the explicit `L_b` (§8.1).
> 2. **The pglogical filtered-table truth table is corrected and is now sound.** Filtered `UPDATE`s are sent as `UPDATE`s; if the target row is absent, apply *skips* it ("can't do INSERT here", `pglogical_apply_heap.c:750`; demonstrated by id=6 in `row_filter.sql:156`/`row_filter.out`). So `P_F ⊆ S` is **false** for pglogical. v4 validates only the sound **filtered-intersection** property for pglogical-filtered tables (§9.4).
> 3. **`best_effort` fences are an explicit, opt-in *degraded* mode that can never yield an exact `match`/`differ`** — they produce a `degraded` verdict; the default is to **abort** when no barrier can be injected (§8.1, §16, §19).
> 4. **The barrier table is standalone, FK-free, and cascade-safe.** It carries a token with **no unique constraint** — under `forward_origins='{all}'` the same token can arrive twice at a target, and a unique key would cause an `insert_insert` conflict that `conflict_resolution = error` turns into an apply stall. It is a normal logged table (pglogical forbids UNLOGGED/TEMP in repsets); run/edge bookkeeping lives in a separate *non-replicated* coordinator table (§16, Appendix A).
> 5. **`track_commit_timestamp` is consistently optional/advisory** (the §5 run-phase text is fixed to match §11.3).
> 6. **Session-sensitive row filters are no longer overclaimed.** Only *immutable, context-free* filters are validated exactly (deparse). Stable-session-sensitive and volatile filters are `unsupported`/`approximate` on a **separate diagnostic path that is not G-SOUND** (§9.5).
> 7. **Repair is tightened**: origin set **before** `BEGIN` and reset **after** `COMMIT` (mirroring `pglogical_sync.c:421/465`); `local_only` repair refuses downstream `forward_origins = {all}` subscriptions because pausing apply workers does not discard retained slot WAL; in-transaction target verification vs post-commit cross-node revalidation are distinguished; `setval` is called out as non-transactional (§18).
> 8. **`row_digest` is `STABLE`, not `IMMUTABLE`** (text fallback depends on pinned session GUCs); canonicalization decisions are pushed by the coordinator as explicit directives so they are uniform across mixed-version nodes (§10.4, §15.1).
> 9. **Verdict states extended** to `indeterminate | partial | approximate | degraded` (§16).
> 10. **Edge identity normalized** (provider/target node, subscription, slot, origin name, repsets, backend), `paranoid_confirm` given a spill bound, and `on_fence_timeout` default changed to `abort_run` (§16, §19).
>
> ### What changed in v3 (second review response)
> The v3 corrections, each traceable to a verified source fact:
> 1. **The consistency proof no longer uses per-tuple LSN.** `pglogical.xact_commit_timestamp_origin(xid)` returns only `(timestamp, roident)` — no commit LSN (`pglogical_functions.c:2370`). v2's "is this tuple older than the edge fence?" test was therefore unimplementable. Replaced by **digest stability across a barrier-converged epoch** (§8), which uses only reliable per-edge convergence and re-readable row digests — both of which exist. A full soundness proof is given.
> 2. **Convergence uses a real per-edge barrier + `wait_slot_confirm_lsn`, not an arbitrary `pg_current_wal_lsn()`.** Origin progress only advances on *applied replicated commits*, so an arbitrary WAL position may never be reached (§8.1). pglogical's `wait_slot_confirm_lsn()` (`pglogical_monitoring.c:31`) is used as documented.
> 3. **`table_data_filtered()` applies the row filter only — no column projection** (`pglogical_functions.c:2086`); column projection comes from `att_list` (§9). Corrected.
> 4. **Row filters run in the replication session** (`README.md:656`): `CURRENT_USER`/volatile expressions are not reproducible in a validator session. v3 detects volatile/session-sensitive filters and either runs `table_data_filtered()` under the apply role or flags the table (§9.4).
> 5. **A complete action-mask × row-filter truth table** grounded in the verified output-plugin behavior — row filter is evaluated on the *new* tuple and the change is *dropped* (not turned into a DELETE) on failure (`pglogical_output_plugin.c:646`) — replaces the hand-wavy weakened-property list (§9.4).
> 6. **Repair is fully specified** against the real `forward_origins ∈ {{}, {all}}` semantics (`README.md:311`): origin creation, loop prevention, local-only vs replicated modes, conflict behavior, locking, FK ordering, privilege, revalidation (§18). `session_replication_role` remains rejected.
> 7. **Collision bounds corrected**: a 256-bit hash gives ≈ 2⁻¹²⁸ generic collision resistance (birthday), not 2⁻²⁵⁶ (§10.2).
> 8. **The set-confirm primitive is real SQL**: `array_agg(rd ORDER BY rd)` into `hash_digest_array(bytea[])` — not a mis-declared scalar used as an aggregate (§10.2, §15).
> 9. **Generated SQL uses `VARIADIC "any"` correctly**: heterogeneous columns are passed as ordinary variadic arguments `row_digest(t.a, t.b, …)`, never a homogeneous `ARRAY[...]` (§12).
> 10. **Physical standby uses the same digest-stability confirm** (replay-LSN convergence), closing the "different logical times" gap (§13.3).
> 11. **`track_commit_timestamp` downgraded to optional/diagnostic** — soundness no longer depends on it (§11.3).
> 12. **Catalogs fixed**: per-edge `fence_attempt`, `divergence.detected_epoch` FK'd to `fence_epoch`, and `repair_run`/`repair_result` + `fence_barrier` DDL added (§16, Appendix A).
>
> ### What changed from v1 (first review response, retained)
> The v2 redesign of the consistency core and pglogical integration. The substantive v2 corrections:
> 1. **Consistency is no longer a current-snapshot commit-timestamp filter.** That approach was unsound: a post-fence `UPDATE` (not just a `DELETE`) makes the old tuple invisible and the new tuple filtered, so the row falsely appears missing. Replaced by a **vector-fence epoch model with hot-key recheck** (Section 8).
> 2. **The fence is a per-origin LSN vector, not a wall-clock `max(commit_ts)`.** Wall-clock commit timestamps are not a cross-node total order (Section 8.2).
> 3. **Validation is defined against pglogical's replication contract** — replication-set action masks, column lists (`set_att_list`), row filters (`set_row_filter`), sequence buffering, and per-table sync state — not against naïve byte-equality (Sections 9, 11).
> 4. **Repair is origin-aware, locked, FK-ordered, and transactional.** `session_replication_role = replica` is explicitly rejected as loop prevention (Section 18).
> 5. **Privilege claims corrected.** pglogical administration requires superuser; validation-compute is least-privilege, but discovery/origin/repair are privileged. The tiers are separated (Section 17).
> 6. **Checksum equality is stated with its true collision bound**, and uses a homomorphic set hash (LtHash) plus a cryptographic sorted-digest confirmation, not an ad-hoc `(sum, sum_sq, xor)` (Section 10).
> 7. **`send` is not assumed universal**; per-type canonical-encoding resolution with a text fallback and explicit failure for unstable types (Section 10.3).
> 8. **pgrx hot path is implementable as specified**: a raw-fcinfo scalar `row_digest(VARIADIC "any")` plus a concrete-typed `#[pg_aggregate]` over `bytea`; planner transparency comes from coordinator-generated SQL, not an opaque relation-scanning function (Sections 10.4, 12).
> 9. **Sequences, TRUNCATE, native logical replication, and physical standbys are designed, not asserted** (Sections 9.5, 13).

## 1. Executive Summary

`pgl_validate` proves whether two or more pglogical-replicating PostgreSQL nodes actually hold the data they are *contractually supposed* to hold, using the two universally understood signals: **row counts** and **content checksums**. Replication can report healthy while data silently diverges (a `keep_local` conflict, a manual subscriber write, an interrupted initial COPY, a skipped apply transaction, decoding edge cases). No first-class, trustworthy verifier exists today.

Three things make this hard, and this design addresses each head-on:

1. **Consistency under lag.** You cannot reconstruct a node's past from its present snapshot, you cannot reduce a multi-origin topology to one timestamp, and PostgreSQL/pglogical expose no per-tuple commit LSN. `pgl_validate` uses a **barrier-converged epoch model with digest-stability confirmation**: a per-edge barrier (a real replicated transaction on a dedicated repset) gives an exact, edge-specific apply cut — proven by the edge's origin progress passing the barrier's exact end LSN, corroborated by token visibility; nodes are read on their own self-consistent snapshots; transient differences are confirmed real only if they **persist with unchanged per-row digests across a later barrier-converged epoch**. Verdicts are anchored to barrier-proven convergence and **sound: a confirmed divergence is always real.**
2. **The replication contract.** Equality is defined by pglogical's metadata, not by naïveté. Column lists, row filters, action masks (insert/update/delete/truncate), sequence buffering, and per-table sync state all change what "in sync" means. `pgl_validate` reads `pglogical.replication_set*`, uses `table_data_filtered()`/`show_repset_table_info()`, and validates the **strongest property the contract guarantees** for each table — never flagging intentional topology behavior as divergence.
3. **Correct, efficient mechanics.** Computation is pushed to each node via coordinator-generated SQL (planner-visible, index-using, parallel-safe). Only digests cross the wire. A homomorphic set hash (LtHash) plus cryptographic confirmation gives order-independent, duplicate-correct comparison with an honest collision bound. Merkle bisection localizes divergence to exact keys. Optional repair is origin-aware, locked, FK-ordered, and transactional.

### Validation strength — read this first

The guarantee `pgl_validate` can *soundly* prove is a function of the **backend** and the **replication contract**, not a single "tables are equal" promise. The most important caveat: **pglogical row-filtered tables can only be validated by content-intersection** — pglogical cannot insert a row that enters the filter via UPDATE (the id=6 case, §9.4), so missing/extra rows are *permitted by the contract* and reported as `advisory`, never as a divergence. Full equality of a filtered table requires native logical replication (PG ≥ 17).

| Backend / contract | What is soundly validated | `validated_property` |
|---|---|---|
| pglogical / native — full `I,U,D,T`, no filter | full row-set + content equality | `full` |
| any — no delete or no truncate (no filter) | provider ⊆ subscriber, content equal (extras legitimate) | `superset` |
| **pglogical — any row filter** | **content equality on co-present in-filter keys only; presence is `advisory`** | `filtered_intersection` |
| native (PG ≥ 17) — row filter, `I,U,D` | full `S = P_F` (filter transitions become INSERT/DELETE) | `full` |
| any — no update (insert-only) | key-set + counts; **no** content equality | `keys_only` |
| pglogical — filtered + no update | co-presence only (advisory) | `filtered_advisory` |
| no insert, or no usable key, or mid-sync | not soundly bounded → skipped/keyless, flagged | `unsupported_mask` / `keyless` |
| any edge fenced without a barrier (opt-in) | cannot be exact | verdict `degraded` |
| non-deterministic row filter (opt-in) | cannot be exact | verdict `approximate` |

Every run records the per-table `validated_property` and stamps the verdict accordingly, so "match" always carries the precise meaning of what was proven.

## 2. Goals and Non-Goals

### Goals

- **G1** Prove contract-correct equality across 2+ nodes with **zero false positives**.
- **G2** Report both **row counts** and **content checksums**, per table and per chunk.
- **G3** Operate **online** with bounded, configurable impact.
- **G4** Be **lag-correct** via vector-fence epochs (G1 holds under arbitrary lag and live load).
- **G5** **Localize** divergence to exact keys (missing/extra/differs).
- **G6** Honor the **pglogical contract** exactly: repsets, column lists, row filters, action masks, sequences, sync state.
- **G7** Support **bidirectional / N-way** topologies with a per-origin fence vector.
- **G8** Be **operable**: async runs, scheduling, progress, resumability, observability.
- **G9** Be **complete and fully tested**, including real multi-node replication scenarios (repository policy).
- **G10** Offer **origin-aware, transactional repair** as an explicit, privileged, opt-in operation.

### Non-Goals

- **NG1** Not a replication engine.
- **NG2** Not a DDL/schema migration tool (it *detects* drift as a precondition failure).
- **NG3** Not a UI/dashboard (exposes SQL, views, metrics).
- **NG4** Does not silently "fix" anything; repair is explicit and gated.

## 3. Problem Statement

Logical replication is eventually consistent and tolerant of local writes and partial contracts, so data can diverge while every health indicator is green:

| Divergence source | Why monitoring misses it |
|---|---|
| Conflict resolved `keep_local`/`skip` | Replication healthy; row legitimately differs |
| Manual write on a subscriber | No replication event |
| Interrupted/partial initial COPY | Subscription later reports `replicating` |
| Apply skipped a transaction | LSN advances; gap invisible |
| Decoding/apply edge cases (toast, types) | Rare, silent |
| Bidirectional split-brain | Both sides "win" different rows |
| **Misread contract** (filter/column/action mask) | Naïve tools flag *intended* differences as bugs |

The last row is why a correct validator must be contract-aware: a row-filtered or insert-only table is *supposed* to differ in specific ways. The operator's question is precise: *"Given what this topology promises, is the data correct?"*

---

## 4. Prior Art and What We Borrow

| Tool / Technique | Adopt | Avoid |
|---|---|---|
| Percona `pt-table-checksum` | Server-side chunked checksums sized to bound per-query time; replication-aware throttling | `BIT_XOR`/CRC combiner (cancels duplicate rows; 32-bit collisions) |
| `pg_comparator` | Merkle bisection to localize divergent keys in `O(log n)` round-trips | `md5(t::text)` (locale/format false positives) |
| Bucardo `validate` | Compare on the replication key; recheck under traffic | No formal convergence gate |
| EDB LiveCompare | Recheck of candidates after convergence; commit-timestamp awareness | (closed; we make the LSN-anchored guarantee explicit) |
| Homomorphic hashing (LtHash, Lewi et al.) | Additive, parallel-safe, **collision-resistant** multiset hash | ad-hoc additive sums with overstated equality |
| pglogical `table_data_filtered()` | Authoritative source for "what the provider would replicate" | hand-rolling row-filter/column-list semantics |

**Run phases:**
1. **Discover & plan** — resolve participants, edges (origins), tables, and each table's *contract* (repset action mask, column list, row filter, sync state) and *comparison key*.
2. **Precondition gate** — extension present, schemas/columns/types compatible, key available, sync state READY (`track_commit_timestamp` is advisory only — §11.3). Fail fast, per table.
3. **Open epoch** — inject a per-edge barrier (dedicated barrier repset) and capture each barrier's exact end LSN; wait for all participants to converge (origin progress past the barrier end LSN, token visible) per §8.
4. **Count & coarse checksum** — per table, compute count + LtHash over a few top chunks on every node concurrently. Compare.
5. **Bisect** — split mismatched chunks (Merkle) until localized.
6. **Localize** — fetch `(key, row_digest)` for small ranges; classify keys; confirm clean chunks with a cryptographic sorted-digest hash.
7. **Recheck** — re-examine candidates at later epochs; confirm only those that persist across convergence; clear hot keys.
8. **Report / optionally repair.**

## 6. Technology Choices

| Concern | Choice | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Language/framework | **Rust + pgrx** | Safe FFI, `panic!`→`ERROR`, PG15–18 from one codebase, aggregate/bgworker/SPI support |
| Row digest | **`row_digest(enc int[], VARIADIC "any") → bytea`**, raw-fcinfo scalar | `enc[]` first (VARIADIC must be last); reads per-arg type via `get_fn_expr_argtype`; isolates all dynamic-type logic in one function |
| Chunk accumulator | **`#[pg_aggregate]` LtHash over `bytea`** | Concrete-typed (implementable in pgrx), additive ⇒ parallel-safe & combinable, collision-resistant |
| Cryptographic confirm | **sorted-digest BLAKE3** per localized chunk | True set hash for clean-dismissal/divergence certainty |
| Node-local execution | **coordinator-generated SQL** run via SPI (local) and libpq (remote) | Planner sees real predicates → index range scans; `EXPLAIN`-able |
| Transport | **libpq** via `pq-sys`, non-blocking | Same auth/TLS/`pg_hba` as core; one `WaitEventSet` polls N peers |
| Orchestration | **background worker** (`pgrx::bgworkers`) | Long runs, scheduling, survives disconnect, throttling |
| Contract source | `pglogical.replication_set*`, `local_sync_status`, `table_data_filtered()`, `show_repset_table_info()`, `show_subscription_table()`, `pg_replication_origin*` | Authoritative; no re-derivation of semantics |

---

## 7. The Three Guarantees

- **G-SOUND (no false positives).** A *confirmed* divergence is real with respect to the contract at the fenced epoch. Lag and live load never yield a divergence verdict (they yield *recheck-pending*, which resolves to cleared or confirmed).
- **G-COMPLETE (no false negatives, modulo bounded collision).** A genuine, persistent, contract-relevant divergence is reported. The only theoretical miss is a hash collision. By default a clean chunk is dismissed on the **LtHash** bound alone (SIS, ≥ 128-bit); a chunk that is *bisected toward a divergence* gets the stronger cryptographic `hash_digest_array` confirmation (≈ 2⁻¹²⁸ at 256-bit) during localization. Cryptographic confirmation of **every** clean chunk is **not** done by default — it requires `paranoid_confirm` (§19). So the honest statement is: divergence confirmation is cryptographic; clean dismissal is LtHash-bounded unless `paranoid_confirm` is set.
- **G-DETERMINISTIC.** Digests are a pure function of canonical logical content: independent of physical order, ctid, vacuum, locale, `DateStyle`, `extra_float_digits`, and parallel-worker count.

---

## 8. Consistency: Barrier-Converged Epochs and Digest-Stability Confirmation

> **What this section must not assume.** PostgreSQL does not expose, for a live tuple, the WAL LSN at which it was last modified. pglogical's `xact_commit_timestamp_origin(xid)` returns only `(timestamp, roident)` — no LSN (`pglogical_functions.c:2370`). Therefore the design must **never** compare a row version to an LSN fence per-tuple. v2 did, and was unsound. v3 uses only two facts that *are* available: (a) **reliable per-edge convergence to a known LSN**, and (b) **re-readable per-row digests**. The soundness proof (§8.4) rests on exactly these.

### 8.1 The convergence primitive: per-edge barrier + slot confirmation

A topology has **edges** `(origin O → target T)`, one per replication stream. To fence edge `(O→T)` *exactly*, `pgl_validate` injects a **barrier** on a **dedicated barrier replication set**. The **authoritative** convergence condition is the named edge's origin progress reaching the barrier's *exact* end LSN; token visibility is required only as a corroborating liveness check (it alone is insufficient — see the cascade caveat):

0. **Setup (once).** `pgl_validate` owns a dedicated replication set `pgl_validate_barrier` with `replicate_insert = true` (others off) containing only the standalone barrier table, and ensures every validated subscription includes it (`pglogical.alter_subscription_add_replication_set`). The barrier therefore flows on **exactly** the subscriptions/slots/origins being validated, with known routing — not piggy-backed on user repsets that might not replicate inserts or route differently.
1. **Inject.** The coordinator drives a **dedicated libpq session on `O`** (transaction control lives in the coordinator, not in a SQL function — see §15.1): `INSERT` a fresh UUID `token` into `pgl_validate.fence_barrier`; `COMMIT`; then `SELECT pgl_validate.last_commit_lsn()` in that same session to read the backend's `XactLastCommitEnd` — the barrier commit's **exact** end LSN `L_b` (not the `pg_current_wal_lsn()` over-estimate).
2. **Flush signal.** Call `pglogical.wait_slot_confirm_lsn(slot(O→T), L_b)` — passing the captured `L_b` **explicitly** rather than relying on the NULL/`XactLastCommitEnd` fallback (`pglogical_monitoring.c:50`), since the coordinator already holds the exact value — to confirm `T` received and flushed the barrier.
3. **Apply proof (edge-specific, exact).** Converge when **both** hold on `T`:
   - **Origin progress past `L_b`:** `pg_replication_origin_progress(origin(O→T), true) >= L_b`. This is the **authoritative, edge-specific** condition — the origin for the `O→T` subscription advances only as `T` applies the `O→T` stream, so reaching `L_b` proves `T` applied that stream through the barrier.
   - **Token visibility:** `SELECT 1 FROM pgl_validate.fence_barrier WHERE token = $1` on `T` (liveness/sanity corroboration).
4. By in-order apply, both holding proves `T` has applied everything `O` sent on this edge up to and including the barrier.

> **Cascade caveat (why token visibility alone is insufficient).** pglogical's default `forward_origins` is `{all}` (`README.md:311`), so in a cascade `O→X→T` the *same* barrier token can reach `T` via `X` while the direct `O→T` stream is still behind. Token visibility would then falsely signal convergence. The origin-progress-past-`L_b` condition is what makes the fence **edge-specific**; token visibility is retained only as a corroborating liveness check.

**Degraded mode (opt-in, never "exact").** If a barrier genuinely cannot be injected on an edge (e.g. the operator declines the dedicated barrier repset), the run does **not** silently weaken: by default it **aborts** that edge (`require_barrier`). Only with explicit `allow_degraded_fence` does it fall back to `wait_slot_confirm_lsn` against a captured LSN — and then every verdict on that edge is stamped **`degraded`**, a distinct outcome that can **never** be reported as exact `match`/`differ` (it does not satisfy G-SOUND).

For a **physical standby** (§13.3) no replicated-commit barrier is needed: all WAL is replayed in order, so `pg_last_wal_replay_lsn() ≥ L` against a plain primary `pg_current_wal_lsn()` `L` is itself an exact, reliable cut (origin progress does not exist on a standby).

**Barrier retention (insert-only ⇒ delete locally, guarded by active epochs).** The barrier table is a **normal, logged** table — pglogical rejects `UNLOGGED`/`TEMP` tables in a replication set (`pglogical_repset.c:1028`), so it cannot be unlogged. Because the `pgl_validate_barrier` repset replicates **inserts only**, a `DELETE`/`TRUNCATE` of old tokens on the origin would **not** propagate — so cleanup cannot go through replication. Instead the coordinator, at end of run and on a schedule, **deletes spent tokens directly and independently on each participant** over libpq.

Cleanup is **not** purely time-based, because a long-running, paused, or lagged run could still have a pending convergence check that needs to observe a token's visibility — deleting it early would (at worst) force a spurious `timeout`/`degraded`. The guard is **structural**: a token is eligible for deletion only if it is **not referenced by any unfinished run's epoch**. The coordinator computes the protected set from its own catalogs

```sql
-- protected = tokens of runs still in flight
SELECT br.token FROM pgl_validate.fence_barrier_run br
JOIN pgl_validate.run r USING (run_id)
WHERE r.status NOT IN ('completed','failed','canceled');
```

and issues, on each node, `DELETE FROM pgl_validate.fence_barrier WHERE injected_at < now() - barrier_retention AND NOT (token = ANY ($1::uuid[]))`. (Implementation note: pass the protected set as a **typed `uuid[]`** and use `NOT (token = ANY(...))` rather than `token <> ALL(...)` — the latter has surprising NULL/empty-array semantics; for large protected sets, prefer an anti-join against a temp table.) So `barrier_retention` (default `1 hour`) is only a *floor* for harmless garbage; an in-flight epoch's token is **never** removed regardless of age. Per-node local cleanup is otherwise always safe — tokens are single-use, and divergent barrier-table contents across nodes are expected and harmless (the barrier table is excluded from validation).

### 8.2 Vector fence (epoch)

An **epoch** `E` records, per edge, the barrier `token(O→T)` and its exact end LSN `L_b(O→T)`. `T` is **converged to `E`** when, for every edge feeding `T`, the §8.1 conjunction holds: `pg_replication_origin_progress(origin(O→T)) >= L_b(O→T)` **and** the token is visible. For bidirectional A↔B, `E` has two entries; for an N-way mesh, one per directed edge. No wall-clock time and no per-tuple LSN are involved — convergence is an exact, edge-specific, in-order apply cut.

### 8.3 Bulk phase (honest, unfiltered reads)

Converge all edges to an initial epoch `E0`. Then open `REPEATABLE READ` transactions on every participant, fired as close together in real time as possible (concurrent libpq), and compute per-chunk `(count, LtHash)` over each node's **current, unfiltered** snapshot — never a commit-ts-filtered view. Because providers keep writing after `E0`, a chunk may still mismatch if a row changed between convergence and snapshot acquisition; such mismatches are *bisected* (§11) and *localized* to candidate keys. For each candidate key the coordinator records every node's `row_digest(k)` from this read — call it **sample A**.

### 8.4 Confirmation by digest stability (the soundness core)

A candidate is **not** a verdict. It is resolved by one or more confirm rounds, each opening a fresh epoch:

1. Inject barriers on every edge **now** (strictly after sample A) → epoch `E1`; converge all edges to `E1`. Because the barriers are injected after sample A, each edge's `E1` LSN is `≥` that edge's position at sample A.
2. Re-read each candidate key's `row_digest(k)` on every node from fresh snapshots taken **after** convergence to `E1` → **sample B**.
3. Decide per key:
   - **Cleared** — sample-B digests now agree across all nodes (it was lag).
   - **Confirmed divergent** — sample-B digests still disagree **and** every node's digest is unchanged between A and B (`digest_A(node,k) == digest_B(node,k)` on every node).
   - **Still hot** — some node's digest changed A→B (the key is being actively written, or replication is still settling). Repeat with a new epoch, up to `recheck_passes` (default 3). Persistent hotness → **indeterminate** (surfaced, and itself meaningful: a continuously-conflicting key in active-active, or a pathological write rate on exactly the divergent key).

**Soundness theorem.** *If a candidate `k` is confirmed, the nodes genuinely differ at `k`.*

*Proof.* Suppose, for contradiction, the difference were merely lag: some replicated change `c` to `k` had been applied on a source node but not yet on node `N` at sample A. Then `c` committed on its edge `(O→N)` **before** sample A, so its commit LSN is `< L_b(O→N)`, the exact end LSN of that edge's `E1` barrier (injected *after* sample A). Convergence to `E1` (§8.2) requires `pg_replication_origin_progress(origin(O→N)) >= L_b(O→N)` — and since the origin for the `O→N` subscription advances strictly in that stream's commit order, reaching `L_b` proves `N` applied **every** `O→N` transaction with commit LSN `< L_b`, including `c`. Applying `c` changes `k`'s value on `N`, so `digest_B(N,k) ≠ digest_A(N,k)` — contradicting the confirmation condition that every node's digest is unchanged A→B. Hence no such pending replicated change exists; the difference is intrinsic to the nodes' committed state and persists under full convergence → real. ∎

The proof rests on the **edge-specific** convergence condition — origin progress past the barrier's exact end LSN `L_b` — which is why it is immune to the cascade case (a token reaching `N` via another path does *not* advance the `O→N` origin). Token visibility is a corroborating liveness check, **not** the load-bearing condition. The proof needs no per-tuple LSN, no LSN over-estimate, no commit timestamp, and no cross-node clock.

### 8.5 Bidirectional / N-way, and the role of commit timestamps

`E` is a vector over **all** directed edges; barriers are injected on each origin and convergence requires every edge. The proof generalizes unchanged — the contradiction fires on whichever edge carried `c`. `xact_commit_timestamp_origin` is used **only as a diagnostic** (to attribute a *confirmed* divergent key to the origin that last wrote it, informing repair-authority hints), never for soundness. Consequently `track_commit_timestamp` is **optional** (recommended for diagnostics and for `last_update_wins` repair), not a precondition (§11.3).

### 8.6 Cost and liveness

The bulk phase is one indexed scan per node (chunked); under load it incurs extra bisection proportional to the write rate in the convergence→snapshot window, which near-simultaneous reads keep small. The confirm phase operates **only** on the localized candidate keys (typically few), re-reading a handful of digests per round. A genuinely divergent key that is not being further modified is confirmed in a single round; a continuously-hot key is bounded by `recheck_passes` → `indeterminate`. Every confirmation is thus gated on **barrier-proven, edge-specific convergence** past a captured epoch, without ever needing a frozen global snapshot of a live multi-writer source.

## 9. The pglogical Replication Contract

Equality is meaningful only relative to what the topology promises. `pgl_validate` reads the contract from pglogical catalogs and validates the **strongest sound property** per table.

### 9.1 Sources (verified against pglogical 2.5.0 schema)

- `pglogical.replication_set(set_id, set_nodeid, set_name, replicate_insert, replicate_update, replicate_delete, replicate_truncate)` — the **action mask**.
- `pglogical.replication_set_table(set_id, set_reloid, set_att_list text[], set_row_filter pg_node_tree)` — **column list** and **row filter**.
- `pglogical.replication_set_seq(set_id, set_seqoid)` + `pglogical.sequence_state(seqoid, cache_size, last_value)` — **sequences**.
- `pglogical.local_sync_status(sync_kind, sync_subid, sync_nspname, sync_relname, sync_status "char", sync_statuslsn)` — **per-table sync state** (`i` init, `s` structure, `d` data, `c` constraints, `w` syncwait, `u` catchup, `y` syncdone, `r` ready).
- `pglogical.show_repset_table_info(relation, repsets) → (relid, nspname, relname, att_list, has_row_filter)` — convenience for column list + filter presence.
- `pglogical.table_data_filtered(NULL::reltype, relation, repsets) → SETOF reltype` — returns the provider rows that **pass the row filter(s)** for the repsets (`pglogical_functions.c:2086`). It applies the **row filter only**; it does **not** project columns — it returns full `reltype` rows. Column projection is obtained separately from `att_list` (`show_repset_table_info` / `replication_set_table.set_att_list`) and applied by `pgl_validate` when computing the digest.
- `pglogical.show_subscription_status()` → `status, provider_node, replication_sets, forward_origins` — topology and edges.
- `pglogical.show_subscription_table(subscription, relation) → status` — per-table sync status from the subscriber side.

### 9.2 Sync state gate

Only tables at `sync_status = 'r'` (READY) on the relevant subscription are content-validated. Tables in `i/s/d/c/w/u/y` are recorded as `skipped (sync_status=X)` with their `sync_statuslsn` — **never** counted as divergence. (`'y'` syncdone-at-lsn means caught up to a point but not promoted to ready; treated as not-ready.)

### 9.3 Column list (`set_att_list`)

`pgl_validate` does **not** re-derive the effective column set from raw `set_att_list` arrays. pglogical builds one effective column bitmap by OR-ing the per-repset `set_att_list`s across all covering repsets (a NULL `set_att_list` in any covering repset means "all columns" and wins), skipping dropped columns (`pglogical_repset.c:466`, `get_table_replication_info`). **`pglogical.show_repset_table_info(relation, repsets)` is the authoritative source** — it returns exactly the resolved `att_list` (the actual column names pglogical would replicate; `pglogical_functions.c:2005-2021`) plus `has_row_filter`. `pgl_validate` calls it and hashes precisely that set; the generated SQL emits those columns sorted by name (§10.1).

### 9.4 Action mask × row filter — the complete truth table

What "in sync" means is a function of the per-repset action flags `(replicate_insert I, replicate_update U, replicate_delete D, replicate_truncate T)` and the row filter `F`. The table below is grounded in pglogical's **verified** output-plugin behavior:

- **Row filter is evaluated on the *new* tuple for INSERT/UPDATE and on the *old* tuple for DELETE; if it fails, the entire change is *dropped* — pglogical does *not* synthesize a DELETE when a row leaves the filter** (`pglogical_output_plugin.c:646-664`). (This differs from native PG17+ row filters, which convert filter-leave updates to deletes — handled in §13.2.)
- Column (`att_list`) filtering is applied independently of row filtering (`pglogical_output_plugin.c:673`).

**The subtlety that makes filtered tables hard (verified).** For an **unfiltered** table, every provider row was necessarily inserted (`I`), so the insert flowed and the row exists on the subscriber — `P ⊆ S` is sound. With a **filter**, this breaks: a row inserted while it *fails* `F` is dropped, and if a later `UPDATE` moves it *into* `F`, pglogical sends that as an **UPDATE** (not an INSERT); the subscriber has no such row, so apply hits "the tuple to be updated could not be found … can't do INSERT here" and **skips** it (`pglogical_apply_heap.c:750`). The pglogical regression suite demonstrates exactly this: `id=6` enters the filter via UPDATEs but is **permanently absent** downstream (`row_filter.sql:156-159`, `expected/row_filter.out`). **Therefore `P_F ⊆ S` is *not* sound for pglogical-filtered tables.** (Native PG ≥ 17 converts filter transitions to INSERT/DELETE and *does* maintain `S = P_F` — §13.2; the backend determines which table applies.)

Let `P` = provider rows (projected to `att_list`), `P_F` = those passing `F`, `S` = subscriber rows (projected). For the **pglogical** backend, the soundly-validatable relation is:

| I | U | D∧T | filter | Sound current-state relation | Content compared? | `validated_property` |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|---|:-:|---|
| ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | none | `S = P` | yes | `full` |
| ✓ | ✓ | ✗ | none | `P ⊆ S` (provider deletes/truncate not propagated ⇒ extras legitimate) | yes | `superset` |
| ✓ | ✓ | any | `F`  | **intersection only**: for keys present on both sides where the *provider* row passes `F`, content matches. Presence is **not** bounded either way (id=6 absence; filter-leave staleness) | yes, on the co-present in-filter set | `filtered_intersection` |
| ✓ | ✗ | ✓ | none | `keys(P) = keys(S)` | **no** (updates drift) | `keys_only` |
| ✓ | ✗ | any | `F`  | even co-present content is not guaranteed (updates not sent) — only co-presence is observable | **no** | `filtered_advisory` |
| ✓ | ✗ | ✗ | none | `keys(P) ⊆ keys(S)` | **no** | `keys_only` |
| ✗ | — | — | any  | no insert flow ⇒ not provider-bounded | — | `unsupported_mask` (skipped, flagged) |

For `filtered_intersection`/`filtered_advisory`, a key present on one side but not the other is reported as **`advisory`**, *never* a confirmed divergence — because the contract genuinely permits it (id=6 / filter-leave). Only a content mismatch on a co-present, in-filter key is a real divergence. The `validated_property` is recorded in `pgl_validate.table_plan` and surfaced in the verdict label (e.g. `match (filtered_intersection)`), so the operator always knows precisely what was proven and what was not. Bidirectional topologies apply this table **per directed edge**; a symmetric full contract (`I,U,D,T`, no filter, `forward_origins = {}`) reduces to `S_A = S_B`.

### 9.5 Generating the provider-side population (row filters run in the replication session)

pglogical evaluates row filters **inside the replication session**, so session-sensitive expressions take the replication user's values, and volatile functions are permitted (`README.md:652-658`). A validator session cannot fully reproduce that context: `SET ROLE` does **not** reproduce `SESSION_USER`, `search_path`, arbitrary GUCs read via `current_setting(...)`, or every context-sensitive stable expression. `pgl_validate` therefore classifies each table's filter conservatively, by scanning the `set_row_filter` node tree:

1. **Immutable and context-free** (no volatile functions, no session/GUC references — the common case, e.g. `id > 0`): deparse via `pg_get_expr(set_row_filter, set_reloid)` and inline it as an **indexable** `WHERE (<filter>)`. This is **exact** because the expression is fully deterministic regardless of session — it stays on the G-SOUND verdict path.
2. **Anything else** (references `CURRENT_USER`/`SESSION_USER`/`current_setting`/`search_path`, or any non-immutable/volatile function): exact reproduction from outside the live decode stream is **not guaranteed**. The table is recorded with `schema_issue = NONDETERMINISTIC_ROW_FILTER` and may be validated only on an explicit, **separate diagnostic path** (`allow_approximate_filters`) that evaluates `pglogical.table_data_filtered()` connected **as the replication user**; its result is stamped **`approximate`** and **never** reported as an exact `match`/`differ`. Without that opt-in, the table is `skipped (reason=nondeterministic_filter)`.

Exact validation thus requires either no filter or an immutable, context-free filter; `approximate` is a clearly-separated, opt-in diagnostic that does not satisfy G-SOUND. The subscriber side is always a plain indexed range scan over filter-passing rows; both sides compute the digest over the same canonical `att_list` columns.

### 9.6 Sequences

pglogical replicates sequences by advancing the subscriber's sequence **ahead** of the provider by a buffer (`sequence_state.cache_size`); subscriber and provider `last_value` are **deliberately not equal**. The validated contract is therefore a *window*, not equality:

```
provider_last_value  <=  subscriber_last_value  <=  provider_last_value + buffer_tolerance
```

where `buffer_tolerance = sequence_buffer_multiplier * cache_size` (default multiplier 2). A subscriber value **below** the provider's is a real defect (risk of duplicate IDs) and is reported; a value within the window is `match`; far above the window is reported as drift. Sequence results live in `pgl_validate.sequence_result` (Section 16).

### 9.7 TRUNCATE

`replicate_truncate = false` means a `TRUNCATE` on the provider does not propagate, which can legitimately produce whole-table divergence; this is surfaced as a contract note, not a silent mismatch. When truncate **is** replicated, no special handling is needed (it manifests as ordinary row presence/absence under the fence).

---

## 10. Checksums and Canonical Encoding

### 10.1 Canonical row digest (G-DETERMINISTIC)

`row_digest(enc int[], VARIADIC "any") → bytea` produces a 256-bit digest over the contract's replicated columns (the generated SQL supplies the columns name-sorted and the aligned `enc[]`):

1. **Columns** = the effective replicated column set as reported by `pglogical.show_repset_table_info()` (§9.3), **emitted by the generated SQL sorted by column name** (robust to differing physical `attnum` across nodes). `row_digest` itself hashes its args positionally; the name-sort happens in `sqlgen`.
2. For each column in canonical order:
   - 1-byte null tag (`0x00` NULL / `0x01` present);
   - if present: canonical value bytes (Section 10.3), `uint32`-length-framed to prevent cross-column aliasing.
3. `digest = BLAKE3(framed bytes)[0..32]` (256-bit; truncatable to 128 via GUC).

The digest is a pure function of logical content — independent of physical order, ctid, page layout, vacuum, locale, and GUCs.

### 10.2 Multiset combination (honest collision bound)

v1 claimed "chunks equal **iff** `(count, sum, sum_sq, xor)` equal." That is false: distinct multisets can collide in those moments without any BLAKE3 collision. Corrected construction:

- **Fast path — LtHash** (lattice-based homomorphic multiset hash; Lewi et al., "Securing Update Propagation with Homomorphic Hashing"). Each row digest is expanded by a BLAKE3-XOF into `n` lanes of `b` bits (default `n=1024`, `b=16`, ~2 KB state); the chunk hash is the component-wise sum mod `2^b`. It is **additive** (hence parallel-safe and mergeable across partial aggregates and across chunks), **order-independent**, and **duplicate-correct**. Its collision resistance reduces to a short-integer-solution (SIS) lattice problem; with the default parameters the security level is ≥ 128 bits. Plus an independent `count`.
- **Confirm path — `hash_digest_array`.** When a chunk is small enough to localize (Section 11), the per-row 256-bit digests are collected **in sorted order** and hashed: `pgl_validate.hash_digest_array(array_agg(rd ORDER BY rd))`. This is computed with the built-in ordered `array_agg` plus a plain `bytea[] → bytea` BLAKE3 function — **not** a custom aggregate (the v2 `sorted_digest(bytea)` was mis-declared as a scalar but used as an aggregate; removed). It is a true cryptographic set hash: two chunks are equal **iff** their digest multisets are equal, except for a hash collision. It is used to (a) confirm a divergence during localization (always), and (b) cryptographically confirm a *clean* dismissal **only** when `paranoid_confirm` is enabled — by default clean chunks are dismissed on the LtHash bound alone.

**Collision bounds (corrected).** A 256-bit BLAKE3 digest provides ≈ **2⁻¹²⁸** *generic* collision resistance (birthday bound), **not** 2⁻²⁵⁶ as v2 stated. So: a chunk dismissed as clean is equal except with probability bounded by the LtHash SIS bound on the fast path (≥ 128-bit), and ≈ 2⁻¹²⁸ once `hash_digest_array` runs (which it does for any chunk near a divergence and, optionally via `paranoid_confirm`, for all chunks). For deployments wanting 256-bit collision resistance, `hash_algorithm = blake3_512` widens the row digest accordingly (≈ 2⁻²⁵⁶). The blanket "iff" of v1 and the 2⁻²⁵⁶ claim of v2 are both removed.

### 10.3 Canonical value encoding (`send` is not universal)

Per replicated column, the canonical encoding is resolved at plan time and pinned for the run:

1. **Binary `send`** (`typsend != 0`) **iff** the type's binary wire format is stable across all participants' PG majors, per a maintained per-type stability table (the standard built-in types are stable; the table encodes known exceptions). Binary `send` is locale/GUC-independent and auto-detoasts.
2. **Canonical text** fallback for types lacking a stable/usable `send`: the value's `out` function under **pinned GUCs** set in the validation session — `extra_float_digits = 3`, `DateStyle = 'ISO, YMD'`, `IntervalStyle = 'iso_8601'`, `bytea_output = 'hex'`, `TimeZone = 'UTC'`, neutral numeric formatting. Text output of a *stored value* is collation-independent (collation governs comparison/order, not representation).
3. **Unsupported** types (no stable `send`, no stable text — exotic extension types) → **precondition failure for that table**, surfaced explicitly. Never silently wrong.

**JSON:** default is **exact byte comparison** for `json` (preserves genuinely-stored differences — whitespace, key order, duplicate keys). Normalization via `jsonb` is **opt-in** (`json_normalize = on`), documented as semantics-changing. `jsonb` storage is already canonical, so its `send` is canonical.

**Float policy:** `-0.0`/`+0.0` and `NaN` bit-patterns are normalized by default (`float_signed_zero_distinct`, `float_nan_distinct` GUCs to opt out). With binary `send` these normalizations are applied to the value before encoding.

**Mixed-version topologies:** the precondition records each participant's PG major and the per-type encoding chosen; if a type's binary format is not stable across the participant set, that column falls back to text (or the table fails the precondition if text is also unstable).

### 10.4 Implementability in pgrx

- `row_digest(enc int[], VARIADIC "any") → bytea` is a **scalar** function implemented at the raw `pg_sys::FunctionCallInfo` level (pgrx exposes fcinfo and `AnyElement`; `get_fn_expr_argtype` resolves each argument's type). `enc` is the **first, non-variadic** argument (PostgreSQL requires `VARIADIC` to be last) and carries the coordinator's per-column encoding-mode code for each variadic column, **positionally aligned** with the variadic args. All dynamic-type logic is confined here. This is acknowledged lower-level pg_sys/cshim work — not a trait-based pgrx aggregate over `"any"`, which pgrx does not support.
- **Canonical column order is the generated SQL's job, not `row_digest`'s.** `row_digest` cannot reorder by column name from raw fcinfo — it hashes its variadic args in the order received. The coordinator's `sqlgen` therefore emits the columns **already sorted by column name** (and emits `enc[]` in the same order). `row_digest` hashes positionally; §10.1's "canonical order" is established upstream in the generated SQL.
- **Volatility is `STABLE`, not `IMMUTABLE`.** The text-fallback path (§10.3) calls type `out` functions whose output can depend on session GUCs (`DateStyle`, `TimeZone`, …), so `row_digest` is **not** immutable — claiming so would be wrong. Determinism *within a run* is instead guaranteed two ways: (1) the coordinator pins the required canonicalization GUCs with `SET LOCAL` in **every** node session (the same `extra_float_digits = 3` / `IntervalStyle` discipline pglogical itself uses for COPY, `pglogical_sync.c:408`); and (2) the **per-column encoding decision is made once by the coordinator and pushed via `enc[]`**, never inferred per-node — so a mixed-version topology cannot have one node choose `send` while another chooses text. This is the cross-node encoding control the API previously lacked.
- `pgl_validate.lthash(bytea) → lthash_state` is a clean **`#[pg_aggregate]`** with concrete `Args = Option<&[u8]>` and a `State = lthash_state` (`#[derive(PostgresType)]` varlena). It implements `state`, `combine`, `serial`/`deserial` (for parallel workers and partial transfer), and `finalize`; declared `parallel_safe`. (It is deterministic given its bytea inputs, but inherits `row_digest`'s `STABLE` classification at the query level.)

Both pieces are independently unit-testable (`#[test]` for the pure byte/lane math; `#[pg_test]` for the in-server behavior).

---

## 11. Chunking, Localization, and Preconditions

### 11.1 Comparison key

In priority order: (1) the table's **replica identity** (PK or `REPLICA IDENTITY` index) — the key replication itself uses; (2) a user-specified unique key; (3) **keyless fallback** (whole-relation set hash + count; hash-bucket sub-chunking for impact control; localization limited to "table differs, no key" with a recommendation to set a replica identity). Keyless tables are still *validated* (the set hash is definitive), only less *localizable*.

### 11.2 Range chunking and Merkle bisection

Key space is partitioned into ordered ranges `[lo, hi)` sized to `chunk_target_rows` (adaptive via `pg_stats` histograms / sampling, capped by `chunk_max_duration`). Range chunking permits **index range scans** and is resumable/throttleable. Composite and text/uuid keys use row-comparison boundaries; boundaries are stored as canonical bytes so they are node-independent.

```
validate_chunk(range):
  per-node = parallel_for T in participants: run generated SQL → (count, lthash) for range
  if all equal: optionally paranoid-confirm; mark CLEAN; return
  if range.rows <= localize_threshold:
      enumerate (key, row_digest) per node; set-diff; hash_digest_array confirm; emit candidates
  else:
      for sub in split(range, split_fanout): validate_chunk(sub)   # parallel
```

Localized keys are classified `missing_on` / `extra_on` / `differs` (subject to the action-mask semantics of Section 9.4), then enter digest-stability confirmation (Section 8.4). Confirmed `differs` keys may carry captured tuples (bounded by `max_reported_tuple_bytes`).

### 11.3 Precondition gate (fail fast, per table)

1. `pgl_validate` present and ABI-compatible on every participant.
2. `track_commit_timestamp` is **recommended but optional** — soundness (§8.4) does **not** depend on it. When off, the only loss is origin attribution diagnostics for confirmed-divergent keys (repair-authority hints) and `last_update_wins`-style repair; a `schema_issue = NO_COMMIT_TS` advisory (not a failure) is recorded. (v2 incorrectly made this a hard precondition for a stable/hot test that no longer exists.)
3. Relation exists; **replicated column set, types, typmods match**; non-deterministic collations flagged.
4. Comparison key present on all nodes (or explicit keyless opt-in).
5. Server encodings compatible (required for cross-node byte comparison).
6. Per-table sync state READY (Section 9.2).
7. Every replicated column has a resolved canonical encoding (Section 10.3), else table fails.

Failures are recorded in `pgl_validate.schema_issue` with a machine code and message; the run continues with remaining tables (`on_precondition_fail = skip_table` default, or `abort_run`).

---

## 12. Node-Local Primitives and Planner Transparency

The node-local checksum is **coordinator-generated SQL**, not an opaque relation-scanning C function. For a full-contract table:

```sql
-- enc[] (first arg) carries the per-column encoding mode; the columns follow as ordinary
-- VARIADIC "any" args, emitted SORTED BY NAME (amount, id, status) -- never an ARRAY[...]
-- (PostgreSQL arrays are single-typed, so ARRAY[t.a, t.b, t.c] would fail on mixed columns).
SELECT count(*) AS n_rows,
       pgl_validate.lthash(
         pgl_validate.row_digest('{2,1,1}'::int[], t."amount", t."id", t."status")) AS h
FROM   public.orders AS t
WHERE  t."id" >= $1 AND t."id" < $2;          -- key-range predicate the planner can index
```

For a row-filtered provider side with an **immutable, context-free** filter (§9.5 case 1), the generated SQL inlines the deparsed filter as an indexable `WHERE`, so **the planner uses the replica-identity index and parallel workers** and `EXPLAIN`/`auto_explain` show exactly what each chunk does. The `pglogical.table_data_filtered(...)` path is used **only** on the explicit `allow_approximate_filters` diagnostic path (§9.5 case 2) — never in the normal exact-validation generator; it is a function scan, labeled non-chunkable, and its results are stamped `approximate`, never exact. (v1's opaque-wrapper "EXPLAIN-friendly" claim remains withdrawn; planner transparency comes from the generated SQL.)

Row-level localization uses an analogous generated query returning `(key, pgl_validate.row_digest(enc, t.<name-sorted cols…>))` for a small range, with the same predicates.

---

## 13. Replication Backends: pglogical, Native, Physical Standby

`pgl_validate` is **pglogical-first**; the other backends are explicitly designed, not assumed.

### 13.1 pglogical (primary)

Topology, edges, contract, sync state, sequences as in Section 9. Origins for the fence vector come from the subscriptions' origin names; `forward_origins` informs cascade edges.

### 13.2 Native logical replication (secondary, fully specified)

- **Topology/state:** `pg_subscription`, `pg_subscription_rel.srsubstate` (`i` init, `d` data copy, `f` finished copy, `s` sync, `r` ready) — only `r` validated.
- **Contract:** `pg_publication(pubinsert, pubupdate, pubdelete, pubtruncate, pubviaroot)`, and per-table row filter `prqual` + column list `prattrs` from `pg_publication_rel`/`pg_publication_tables`. The action mask maps to the same weakened-property table as Section 9.4. Row filters are deparsed via `pg_get_expr(prqual, prrelid)` into an indexable predicate (no `table_data_filtered()` equivalent exists in core).
- **Filter-transition difference from pglogical:** native PG ≥ 17 row filters **do** convert an UPDATE whose new row leaves the filter into a DELETE on the subscriber (and old-leaves/new-matches into an INSERT). So the native truth table is *much stronger* than pglogical's §9.4 for filtered tables: with `I,U,D` and a filter, native maintains full `S = P_F` — whereas pglogical can only validate `filtered_intersection` (the id=6 absence cannot occur under native because the filter-enter UPDATE is delivered as an INSERT). `pgl_validate` selects the pglogical or native variant of the truth table per backend.
- **Partition root:** honor `pubviaroot` — validate at root or leaf consistently across nodes.
- **Fence — native barrier lifecycle (explicit).** Native has no replication sets, so `pgl_validate` builds the equivalent on core primitives:
  - **Setup (additive, permanent):** a dedicated publication `pgl_validate_barrier_pub` with `publish = 'insert'` containing only `pgl_validate.fence_barrier`. It is **added to** each validated subscription with `ALTER SUBSCRIPTION … ADD PUBLICATION pgl_validate_barrier_pub WITH (copy_data = false, refresh = true)` — `ADD` (not `SET`) **preserves the subscription's existing publication list**, and `copy_data = false` skips an initial COPY (barrier tokens are transient; no history is needed). The membership is **permanent** (established once, like the pglogical barrier repset, not toggled per run) to avoid repeated catalog/DDL churn and `REFRESH` races. The subscription's existing slot/origin (`pg_<subid>`) carries the barrier, so it is on exactly the validated edge.
  - **Convergence:** the **authoritative** signal is the same edge-specific origin check — `pg_replication_origin_progress('pg_<subid>') >= L_b`. Core has no `wait_slot_confirm_lsn`, so the provider-side flush signal polls `confirmed_flush_lsn` from `pg_replication_slots` for that edge's slot directly; token visibility corroborates.
  - **Refresh/failure handling:** if `REFRESH PUBLICATION` cannot run (subscription disabled, `copy_data` constraints) or the slot/origin cannot be mapped to the edge, the edge is treated as **un-fenceable** → abort by default, or `degraded` under explicit opt-in (as in §8.1). Native row-filter `prqual` is deparsed only when immutable/context-free (the §9.5 rule applies identically); otherwise `approximate`.
  - **Retention:** identical to §8.1 — inserts-only publication means token cleanup is per-node direct `DELETE` over libpq, never via replication.

### 13.3 Physical standby (secondary, read-only participant)

- A standby is **read-only** and has **no replication origins**, so it is a **participant** only, never a coordinator; no result catalogs are written there.
- A standby is a byte-exact physical copy, so the contract is **full equality of all tables** (no filters/column lists/action masks).
- **Fence/convergence:** unlike a logical edge, a standby replays *all* WAL, so a barrier transaction is unnecessary — `pg_last_wal_replay_lsn() ≥ L` against a plain primary `pg_current_wal_lsn()` `L` is itself reliable (the §8.1 reachability caveat does not apply to physical replay).
- **Soundness uses the same §8.4 digest-stability confirm.** v2's concern that "a primary's current snapshot and a standby's replay snapshot observe different logical times" is real but is handled exactly as for logical edges: a candidate difference is confirmed only if it persists with **unchanged digests on both the primary and the standby** across convergence to a later replay-LSN fence captured after the first read. The proof of §8.4 carries over with "applied through `E1[edge]`" replaced by "replayed through `L1`." No per-tuple LSN is needed.
- The coordinator must be a primary; standby results are stored on the coordinator's catalogs.

## 14. Distributed Execution Model

### 14.1 Roles

- **Coordinator** — a *primary* participant; its background worker drives the state machine, owns the run's catalog rows, opens libpq to peers, and generates per-chunk SQL. Role is per-run.
- **Participant** — any node (incl. read-only standbys) holding a copy; computes its own digests via generated SQL.
- **Reference** — the comparison baseline for missing/extra classification (default: the table's pglogical provider/origin; configurable).

### 14.2 Connectivity and wire payloads

libpq, non-blocking, one `WaitEventSet` polling N peers, so a chunk fan-out costs ≈ 1× latency. DSNs resolve from explicit args, `pglogical.node_interface.if_dsn`, or `pgl_validate.peer`. Across the wire: `(count, lthash)` per chunk (~2 KB), `(key, 32-byte digest)` only for small divergent ranges, and (optional, capped) full tuples for confirmed `differs` keys. **Table data is never shipped for comparison.**

### 14.3 Parallelism

Across nodes (async libpq), across chunks (`max_parallel_chunks`), and within a node (the `parallel_safe` LtHash aggregate uses PG parallel workers). All three compose; defaults are conservative.

---

## 15. SQL API Surface

All objects in schema `pgl_validate`. Functions are `SECURITY INVOKER` unless noted; privilege requirements per Section 17.

### 15.1 Node-local primitives

```sql
-- Scalar digest over a heterogeneous row. enc[] is the FIRST arg (VARIADIC must be last) and
-- carries the coordinator's per-column encoding mode, positionally aligned with the columns;
-- the generated SQL passes columns ALREADY SORTED BY NAME. Called as
-- row_digest('{1,1,2}'::int[], c_a, c_b, c_c) -- NOT with an ARRAY of columns.
-- STABLE (not IMMUTABLE): text-fallback encoding depends on pinned session GUCs (§10.4).
pgl_validate.row_digest(enc int[], VARIADIC "any") RETURNS bytea STABLE PARALLEL SAFE;  -- raw-fcinfo scalar
-- LtHash multiset accumulator: a real aggregate over the per-row bytea digests.
pgl_validate.lthash(bytea) RETURNS pgl_validate.lthash_state PARALLEL SAFE;         -- #[pg_aggregate]
pgl_validate.lthash_combine(pgl_validate.lthash_state, pgl_validate.lthash_state)   -- exposed for tests
    RETURNS pgl_validate.lthash_state IMMUTABLE PARALLEL SAFE;
-- Cryptographic set-hash for localized chunks: a PLAIN function over an already-sorted
-- bytea[]; the ordering is supplied by the caller's array_agg(... ORDER BY ...). This is
-- deliberately NOT an aggregate (v2's sorted_digest(bytea) was mis-declared).
pgl_validate.hash_digest_array(bytea[]) RETURNS bytea IMMUTABLE PARALLEL SAFE;
-- Usage: SELECT pgl_validate.hash_digest_array(array_agg(rd ORDER BY rd)) FROM (... ) s(rd);
-- Fence helpers. last_commit_lsn() returns the calling backend's XactLastCommitEnd — the EXACT
-- end LSN of the barrier commit just made (§8.1), used for the edge's origin-progress check.
pgl_validate.last_commit_lsn() RETURNS pg_lsn;        -- exact XactLastCommitEnd of this session
-- NOTE: barrier injection is NOT a SQL function — a plain function cannot do transaction control.
-- The coordinator performs INSERT + COMMIT directly over its libpq session on the origin, then
-- calls last_commit_lsn() in that same session. (A top-level CALL pgl_validate.inject_barrier(edge)
-- PROCEDURE is offered for manual/diagnostic use, since PROCEDUREs may COMMIT; it is not used on the
-- normal path.) Barrier cleanup is likewise driven by the coordinator (§8.1 retention).
-- Introspection of the SQL the engine WILL generate (planner-transparent, EXPLAIN-able):
pgl_validate.plan_chunk_sql(rel regclass, key_cols text[], lo bytea, hi bytea,
                            cols text[], repsets text[] DEFAULT NULL) RETURNS text STABLE;
```

### 15.2 Orchestration

```sql
pgl_validate.compare(
    tables    regclass[] DEFAULT NULL,    -- explicit; NULL => expand repset/auto
    repset    text       DEFAULT NULL,    -- pglogical replication set
    peers     text[]     DEFAULT NULL,    -- DSNs/node names; NULL => discover
    reference text       DEFAULT NULL,    -- baseline; NULL => provider
    options   jsonb      DEFAULT '{}'     -- per-run GUC overrides
) RETURNS bigint;                          -- run_id

pgl_validate.compare_table(table_name regclass, peers text[] DEFAULT NULL,
                           options jsonb DEFAULT '{}') RETURNS pgl_validate.table_result;
pgl_validate.cancel(run_id bigint) RETURNS boolean;
pgl_validate.pause(run_id bigint)  RETURNS boolean;
pgl_validate.resume(run_id bigint) RETURNS boolean;   -- also resumes a crashed run
```

### 15.3 Results

```sql
pgl_validate.run_status(run_id bigint)  RETURNS pgl_validate.run;
pgl_validate.divergences(run_id bigint) RETURNS SETOF pgl_validate.divergence;
pgl_validate.sequences(run_id bigint)   RETURNS SETOF pgl_validate.sequence_result;
pgl_validate.report(run_id bigint)      RETURNS jsonb;
-- Views over the catalogs (Section 16): runs, run_progress, table_results,
--   chunk_results, divergences, sequence_results, schema_issues.
```

### 15.4 Repair (privileged; Section 18)

```sql
pgl_validate.generate_repair(run_id bigint, authoritative text) RETURNS SETOF text;
pgl_validate.apply_repair(
    run_id bigint, authoritative text, target text, confirm text,
    propagation text DEFAULT 'local_only',          -- 'local_only' | 'replicate' (§18.2)
    acknowledge_conflict_policy boolean DEFAULT false -- required for 'replicate'
) RETURNS pgl_validate.repair_run;                    -- origin-aware, locked, FK-ordered, transactional
-- Per-key outcomes land in pgl_validate.repair_result (FK repair_id).
```

---

## 16. Catalog and Data Model

State is persisted (typed, normalized, FK-linked) so runs are resumable and auditable. Full DDL in [Appendix A](#appendix-a-catalog-ddl). Key tables:

- `run` — one row per run; status enum `planning|fencing|running|paused|rechecking|completed|failed|canceled`.
- `run_participant` — per node: role, pg_version, backend (`pglogical|native|standby`), DSN ref, per-node status.
- `run_edge` — **normalized edge identity** (provider node, target node, subscription, slot, origin name, repsets, backend); referenced by `fence_*` via `edge_id` because `'A->B'` text cannot distinguish multiple DBs/subscriptions/slots/repsets/origins between the same node pair.
- `fence_epoch` / `fence_edge` — the **vector fence per epoch** (`fence_edge(run_id, epoch_seq, edge_id, barrier_token, barrier_end_lsn, degraded)`), plus `fence_attempt` keyed **per (run, epoch, edge_id)**; each edge converges independently and records `origin_progress_lsn` vs `barrier_end_lsn` (**the authoritative, edge-specific condition** — origin progress ≥ the barrier's exact end LSN), `token_visible` (corroborating liveness), `confirmed_flush_lsn`, and `status` (incl. `degraded`).
- `fence_barrier` — **standalone, FK-free, and deliberately NON-unique on `token`** (a cascade can deliver the same token twice; a unique constraint would cause an `insert_insert` conflict that `conflict_resolution = error` turns into an apply stall). A normal logged table (pglogical forbids UNLOGGED/TEMP in repsets); the only `fence_*` table added to a repset. Run/edge linkage lives in the **non-replicated** `fence_barrier_run`.
- `table_plan` — per (run, table): key_cols, **contract** (repset action mask, has_row_filter, att_list, repsets), sync_status, and the `validated_property` actually checked (full / superset / keys_only / filtered_intersection / filtered_advisory / keyless / unsupported_mask).
- `table_result` (FK→`table_plan`) — verdict `match|differ|indeterminate|partial|approximate|degraded|skipped|error|fence_timeout`.
- `table_node_result` — per (run, table, node): `n_rows bigint`, `lthash bytea`, `set_hash bytea` (typed, not JSONB).
- `chunk_result` — per (run, table, chunk_id, parent_id): `lo/hi bytea`, state enum `pending|running|clean|split|divergent|candidate`.
- `chunk_node_result` — per (chunk, node): `n_rows`, `lthash`.
- `divergence` — per key: `classification (missing_on|extra_on|differs)`, `node`, `key_text`, `key_bytes`, `status (candidate|confirmed|cleared|indeterminate|advisory)`, detection epoch FK, optional `tuple jsonb` (capped). The `advisory` status carries the §9.4 filtered-table presence differences that the contract permits and that are therefore **never** promoted to `confirmed`.
- `divergence_recheck` — per (divergence, epoch_seq): outcome.
- `conflict_evidence` — optional pglogical conflict-history rows correlated to confirmed divergences by subscription, relation, time window, and tuple JSON containing the divergent key. This is explanatory evidence (`update_update` + `keep_local`, `skip`, etc.), never a source of validation truth.
- `sequence_result` — per sequence: provider/subscriber `last_value`, `cache_size`, `within_contract boolean`, verdict.
- `schema_issue` — per precondition failure (FKs).

All child tables carry FKs to `run` / `table_plan` with `ON DELETE CASCADE`; states referenced in prose (`running`, `candidate`, etc.) are present in the CHECK enums. Critical checksums and fences are **typed columns / child tables**, not opaque JSONB. Retention via `pgl_validate.purge(before timestamptz)` and optional scheduled cleanup.

Resumability: every visited chunk's verdict is committed; a resumed run skips `clean` chunks and re-fences from the frontier (safe — verdicts are per-chunk and convergence-gated). A crashed coordinator's held snapshots are gone, so resume opens a fresh epoch.

---

## 17. Privilege and Security Model

v1's "no superuser required" was false. **pglogical replication and administration require superuser** (pglogical `README.md`). The privilege tiers are separated:

| Tier | Capability | Privilege |
|---|---|---|
| **T1 — Validate (compute)** | Run generated checksum SQL: `SELECT` on validated tables, `EXECUTE` on `pgl_validate.row_digest`/`lthash`/`hash_digest_array`, `CONNECT`/`USAGE` | Least-privilege read-only role |
| **T2 — Discover** | Read pglogical catalogs, call `table_data_filtered()`/`show_*`, read `pg_replication_origin_progress`, sync status | Elevated: effectively **superuser** in pglogical topologies (per pglogical's model), or a role granted access to pglogical catalogs + replication-monitor functions |
| **T3 — Orchestrate** | Launch background workers, write `pgl_validate.*` catalogs | `pgl_validate` owner role; dynamic bgworker registration may require superuser depending on deployment |
| **T4 — Repair** | Origin setup/advance, locking, DML on target | **Superuser / replication-origin + table-owner privileges** |

Security properties: only digests/keys cross the wire by default; full-tuple capture is opt-in and capped; functions are `SECURITY INVOKER` (the aggregate cannot read tables the caller cannot); DSNs follow libpq conventions (`.pgpass`, services, TLS) and any stored DSNs are `REVOKE`d from `PUBLIC`; every run, its options, its launcher, and every repair statement are audited in catalogs. The validation path issues **no writes** to user data; repair is the only writer and is T4-gated.

---

## 18. Repair and Reconciliation

Repair is **opt-in, single-target, transactional, locked, FK-ordered, and explicit about propagation**, and is designed against pglogical's *actual* origin-forwarding semantics — which support only `forward_origins ∈ {{}, {all}}` (`README.md:311-315`), **not** arbitrary per-repair routing. `session_replication_role = replica` is **explicitly rejected** (it is not an origin mechanism, requires elevated privilege, and changes trigger semantics).

### 18.1 Generate

`generate_repair(run_id, authoritative)` emits the minimal DML to reconcile each non-authoritative node to `authoritative` for **confirmed** divergent keys only, and only those that are divergences *under the table's validated property* (§9.4) — e.g. it never "fixes" `extra_on(sub)` for a `superset`/`keys_only` contract, and for `keys_only` it reconciles key presence, not content. It emits `INSERT` for `missing_on`, `DELETE` for `extra_on` (full contract only), `UPDATE` for `differs`, using canonical values. Output is reviewable text; nothing is applied.

### 18.2 Origin model and loop prevention (the complete specification)

The repair tags its writes with a dedicated origin, and — mirroring pglogical's own sync path, which sets the origin **before** `BEGIN` and resets it **after** `COMMIT` (`pglogical_sync.c:421, 465`) — the exact ordering is mandatory: `pg_replication_origin_create('pgl_validate_repair')` (once, idempotent); then **outside/before** the repair transaction `pg_replication_origin_session_setup('pgl_validate_repair')`; then `BEGIN … COMMIT`; then `pg_replication_origin_session_reset()` after commit (to avoid races on the origin with other backends). Whether those writes leave the target is **fully determined by the target's outbound subscriptions' `forward_origins`** — there is no per-write routing knob. `apply_repair` takes an explicit `propagation` mode and validates it against the topology:

- **`local_only` (default).** The repair must not propagate off `target`.
  - If every downstream subscription from `target` uses `forward_origins = {}` (the bidirectional norm): an origin-tagged write is treated as "received from elsewhere" and is **not re-forwarded** — loop prevention by exactly the mechanism pglogical already uses.
  - If any registered downstream subscription uses `forward_origins = {all}` (cascade): origin tagging cannot stop propagation, and merely disabling/re-enabling the subscription is **not** a sound fix because the subscription's slot retains the repair WAL and can decode it after re-enable. Therefore `local_only` is refused before applying DML, with the forwarding subscriptions recorded in the repair error. `pgl_validate` never pauses, disables, or rewrites pglogical subscription state to force the repair through; the operator must change the topology outside the repair run (for example by recreating the downstream subscription with `forward_origins = {}` where pglogical requires that) or choose `replicate` with an explicit conflict-policy acknowledgement.
- **`replicate`.** Written as a **local-origin** change (no origin setup), allowed to flow downstream; conflicts at peers are resolved by each peer's `pglogical.conflict_resolution` (converges to the authoritative value only if peers do not keep local). Refused unless `acknowledge_conflict_policy := true`; effective per-peer resolution is recorded.

### 18.3 What is and isn't transactional (stated honestly)

`apply_repair(run_id, authoritative, target, confirm, propagation, …)` is guarded by a type-to-confirm token equal to the target node name, and is transactional **for the row DML**, with explicit non-transactional steps called out:

1. **Establish propagation mode** per §18.2 (origin session setup before `BEGIN`; or preflight refusal when downstream `forward_origins = {all}` would forward a `local_only` repair).
2. `BEGIN`. **Lock** the divergent keys on `target` (`SELECT … FOR UPDATE`).
3. **FK-ordered DML.** `INSERT`s parent→child, `DELETE`s child→parent (topological sort over `pg_constraint`); `UPDATE`s for `differs`.
4. **In-transaction verification.** Before commit, re-read the repaired keys *on the target* and assert they now equal the authoritative values — this is what the lock protects, and it either holds or the transaction **rolls back** (atomic for the row DML).
5. `COMMIT`; then `pg_replication_origin_session_reset()`. **The locks release at commit**, so the subsequent **cross-node** revalidation (a focused mini-run against all peers) runs *without* holding locks and is recorded as the authoritative post-repair verdict — it is explicitly a *post*-commit check, not part of the atomic unit.
6. **Sequences are non-transactional.** `setval` is **not** rolled back by a transaction abort, so sequence reconciliation is performed as a **separate, clearly-labeled non-transactional step** (after the row DML commits) and recorded as such in `repair_result(action = 'setval')`. The "transactional" guarantee covers the row DML in steps 2–5, not `setval`.

### 18.4 Bidirectional caveat

In active-active, repairing a conflicted key requires designating an authority. `local_only` reconciles just the `target`; full mesh convergence then relies either on a subsequent authoritative write or on `replicate` mode with a compatible conflict policy. This is genuinely delicate, is T4-privileged (superuser; origin + table-owner), and defaults to **generate-only** — `apply_repair` is always an explicit, separate, audited step.

---

## 19. Configuration, Governance, Observability

### 19.1 GUCs (selected; all `pgl_validate.*`, overridable per-run via `options`)

| GUC | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `hash_algorithm` | `blake3_256` | row digest width / algo (`blake3_256`\|`blake3_128`\|`sha256_*`) |
| `lthash_lanes` / `lthash_lane_bits` | `1024` / `16` | set-hash collision bound vs state size |
| `paranoid_confirm` | `off` | run the cryptographic `hash_digest_array` confirm on **every** clean chunk. Bounded by `paranoid_confirm_max_rows` (default = `localize_threshold`): a clean chunk larger than this is **subdivided** so `array_agg(ORDER BY)` never materializes an unbounded array; an external/streaming sorted-hash path is used above the in-memory cap |
| `paranoid_confirm_max_rows` | `1000` | per-statement row cap for the sorted-set confirm; larger chunks are split or stream-sorted (memory/spill bound) |
| `chunk_target_rows` | `50000` | adaptive chunk sizing |
| `chunk_max_duration` | `2s` | split-and-retry threshold |
| `split_fanout` | `4` | Merkle children per level |
| `localize_threshold` | `1000` | switch to row-level localization |
| `max_parallel_chunks` | `4` | concurrent chunk subtrees |
| `fence_convergence_timeout` | `5min` | wait for a peer to reach a fence |
| `on_fence_timeout` | `abort_run` | `abort_run` (default — a requested comparison that loses a peer is **not** silently downgraded) \| `skip_peer` (explicit opt-in; the run is then stamped `partial`, never plain `match`) |
| `require_barrier` | `on` | abort an edge that cannot be barrier-fenced; set `allow_degraded_fence` to opt into `degraded` verdicts instead |
| `recheck_passes` | `3` | epochs before confirm/indeterminate |
| `max_snapshot_age` | `5min` | re-fence to bound vacuum impact |
| `statement_timeout_per_chunk` | `30s` | hard per-chunk cap |
| `throttle_max_lag` | `off` | pause if any peer's lag exceeds this |
| `json_normalize` | `off` | normalize `json` via `jsonb` (semantics-changing) |
| `float_signed_zero_distinct` / `float_nan_distinct` | `off` | float normalization policy |
| `sequence_buffer_multiplier` | `2` | sequence window tolerance × `cache_size` |
| `max_reported_tuple_bytes` | `8192` | cap captured divergent tuples |
| `read_role` | (unset) | T1 role to use on peers |

### 19.2 Governance

Bounded per-chunk statements (`chunk_max_duration`, `statement_timeout_per_chunk`); **snapshot-age cap** with re-fence to bound vacuum/bloat from held `REPEATABLE READ` transactions; **lag-aware throttle** (never harm the replication being validated); inter-chunk I/O throttle; conservative parallelism caps. Read-only validation path.

### 19.3 Observability

Reporting surfaces: `runs`, `run_progress` (chunks done/total, ETA, bytes scanned, phase, current epoch), `table_results`, `chunk_results`, `divergences`, `conflict_evidence`, `sequence_results`, `schema_issues`. `report(run_id)` returns a complete structured JSON verdict (per-table contract + property validated, counts per node, confirmed keys, correlated pglogical conflict evidence, sequence windows, timing, resource stats) suitable for CI gates. `metrics()` exposes stable counters/gauges (runs by status, tables matched/differing, last successful validation per table, rows scanned, bytes transferred) for scraping. Phase transitions, per-epoch fence vectors, convergence waits, throttle events, and re-fences are logged with the run id via `log!`/`ereport!`.

```

**Boundary discipline** (per the cargo-pgrx skill): pure logic — encoding rules, LtHash/sorted-digest math, Merkle planning, contract parsing of fetched rows, FK topological sort — lives in `#[test]`-able modules with **zero `pg_sys` contact**; anything touching SPI/relations/GUC-runtime/libpq/workers is `#[pg_test]` or runtime-only. No `pg_sys` symbols ever appear inside `#[test]`.

**Hot path** is exactly two custom objects (`row_digest` scalar via raw fcinfo; `lthash` concrete-typed aggregate); everything else is planner-visible generated SQL (Section 12), so the design is implementable within pgrx's actual capabilities.

---

## 21. Testing Strategy

Per repository policy, **every feature ships with complete regression tests exercising the full path with real provider/subscriber replication** — no schema-only or simplified tests.

### 21.1 Pyramid

1. **`#[test]` (pure Rust):** encoding rules (null tag, length framing, name-ordering, send-vs-text selection, float/json policy), LtHash lane math (commutativity, associativity, duplicate sensitivity) and its collision-bound parameters, sorted-digest set-hash, Merkle split/boundary math, FK topological sort, contract parsing.
2. **`#[pg_test]` (in-server):** `row_digest`/`lthash`/`hash_digest_array` over real tables — order independence (post-`CLUSTER`), parallel-worker equivalence (`max_parallel_workers_per_gather` 0 vs N), all scalar/container/json/numeric/bytea/array/composite/timestamptz types, keyless path.
3. **`cargo pgrx regress`:** golden output for the SQL API, generated-SQL shape, views, GUCs, schema-issue codes, repair DML.
4. **Multi-node integration harness (centerpiece):** brings up **two+ real PostgreSQL instances**, installs `pgl_validate` on each, configures **real pglogical replication** (and a native-logical path, and a physical-standby path), runs end-to-end scenarios.

### 21.2 Mandatory scenarios (each fully implemented)

| Scenario | Asserts |
|---|---|
| Clean sync, idle and under live write load | No false positives under lag (G-SOUND); hot keys cleared by recheck |
| Missing / extra / value-drift on subscriber | Localized to exact key; correct classification; survives recheck |
| **Post-fence UPDATE on provider** (the v2 bug) | Candidate raised then **cleared** by recheck — no phantom-missing |
| Post-fence DELETE on provider | Cleared by recheck |
| **Barrier convergence is exact & edge-specific** | Converge on `origin_progress(origin(O→T)) ≥ L_b` (authoritative) with `wait_slot_confirm_lsn(slot, L_b)` and token visibility as corroboration; **cascade test**: a token reaching T via `O→X→T` must NOT mark the direct `O→T` edge converged |
| **Cascade duplicate token + `conflict_resolution = error`** | In `O→X→T` *and* `O→T` with `forward_origins='{all}'`, the same token arrives twice at T; with no unique constraint the duplicate is a harmless heap row and apply does **not** error/stall (the explicit test the review requires) |
| **pglogical filtered-table id=6 case** (`row_filter.sql:156`) | Row that enters the filter via UPDATE is legitimately absent downstream → reported `advisory`, **never** a confirmed divergence (G-SOUND) |
| **Native filtered table** (PG ≥ 17) | Filter-enter UPDATE delivered as INSERT → full `S = P_F` validated (stronger than pglogical) |
| **Degraded fence (no barrier)** | Default **aborts**; with `allow_degraded_fence`, verdict is `degraded` and never `match`/`differ` |
| **Non-deterministic row filter** (`current_setting`/`CURRENT_USER`) | Exact path refused; only `approximate` under explicit opt-in, never on the G-SOUND path |
| **Column list** (`set_att_list`) | Only listed columns hashed; non-listed differences ignored |
| **Insert-only repset** (no update) | Validates keys+counts only; content drift **not** flagged |
| **No-delete repset** | `extra_on(sub)` **not** a divergence; missing/differs still caught |
| **Mid-sync table** (`sync_status != 'r'`) | Skipped with reason, not divergence |
| **Sequence drift** | Within-window = match; subscriber-below-provider = reported defect |
| Duplicate-row table (no PK) | LtHash detects the dup that XOR would miss; keyless verdict definitive |
| Schema/type/collation drift | Precondition failure with code; other tables still validated |
| Bidirectional conflict (`keep_local`) | Real divergence detected; vector fence + origin attribution correct |
| Mixed PG major versions | Encoding falls back to text where send-format unstable; no false positive |
| Native logical replication (row filter + pubactions) | Contract honored as for pglogical |
| Physical standby participant | Full-equality contract; replay-LSN fence; coordinator on primary |
| Repair: origin set-before-BEGIN / reset-after-COMMIT; multi-table FK ordering; `replicate` vs `local_only` | Post-repair `match`; no replication loop; FK order correct |
| Repair with downstream `{all}` cascade subscription | `local_only` is refused before DML; no target mutation occurs; operator must reconfigure or choose `replicate` |
| Sequence repair is non-transactional | `setval` reconciliation recorded separately; row-DML rollback does not un-`setval` |
| Resume after coordinator kill mid-run | Resumes from frontier; final verdict identical |
| Throttle / lag-pause | Pauses above threshold; resumes |

### 21.3 Property/differential

proptest over encoding+LtHash+sorted-digest (equal multisets ⇒ equal hashes; single perturbation ⇒ different, modulo stated bound); differential test of the aggregate vs an independent in-test reference (sorted, framed) computation. CI matrix PG15–18 × Linux/macOS/Windows, consistent with the fork's pipeline.

## 22. Edge Cases and Failure Modes

| Case | Handling |
|---|---|
| Peer unreachable mid-run | libpq error → peer `unreachable`; default `on_fence_timeout = abort_run`; only with explicit `skip_peer` does the run continue, stamped `partial` (never plain `match`) |
| Replication broken / never converges | Convergence timeout → table `fence_timeout`, never a false `match` |
| Barrier cannot be injected on an edge/repset | Default: **abort that edge** (`require_barrier`). Only with explicit `allow_degraded_fence` does it fall back to `wait_slot_confirm_lsn`; every verdict on that edge is then `degraded` and can never be `match`/`differ` |
| `track_commit_timestamp = off` | Advisory `NO_COMMIT_TS` only — soundness is independent of it (§8.4/§11.3); origin-attribution diagnostics and `last_update_wins` repair are disabled |
| No replica identity | Keyless path; table verdict definitive; localization limited and stated |
| Non-deterministic collation column | Hashed by canonical bytes (matches replication's own equality); flagged |
| Unstable `send` / exotic type | Text fallback, or per-table precondition failure; never silently wrong |
| Continuously-hot key | `recheck_passes` cap → `indeterminate` with diagnostics (itself meaningful) |
| Snapshot too old | Re-fence at `max_snapshot_age`; per-table fences keep cost low |
| DDL during a run | Affected table errors and is re-planned on resume; others unaffected |
| Whole-table divergence | Bisection still localizes; enumerated keys capped (`max_reported_divergences`) with a summary count |
| Partitioned tables | Each leaf validated independently; `pubviaroot`/parent semantics honored; parent = aggregate of leaves |
| Coordinator on a standby | Rejected at planning: coordinator must be a primary |

---

## 23. Cross-Version Compatibility and Packaging

- **Supported:** PostgreSQL 15–18 (the fork's window). pgrx feature flags `pg15`–`pg18`; one cdylib per major.
- **Version-sensitive surfaces** isolated in `compat/`: `pg_replication_origin_progress`, `pg_xact_commit_timestamp_origin`, the per-type `send`-format stability table, snapshot/`REPEATABLE READ` helpers, parallel-aggregate `serial`/`deserial`. Gated with `#[cfg(feature = "pgNN")]` / `PG_VERSION_NUM`.
- **Mixed-version topologies:** comparison over canonical encoding is valid iff the chosen encoding is stable across the participants' majors; the precondition records versions and per-type choices and falls back to text or flags accordingly.
- **Packaging:** `cargo pgrx package` per major (Linux/macOS/Windows, including a Windows build, mirroring the fork's release pipeline). `CREATE EXTENSION pgl_validate;` on **every** participant; scheduling additionally needs `shared_preload_libraries = 'pgl_validate'`. No user-schema changes; all objects under `pgl_validate`. pglogical support is a mandatory release and regression-test gate, and pglogical must be installed on pglogical participants. Native logical and standby modes are additional backend paths, not a reason to weaken pglogical coverage. Standard `--X.Y.sql` / `--X.Y--A.B.sql` scripts.

## 24. Milestones

| Milestone | Deliverable | Tests gating completion |
|---|---|---|
| **M1 — Digest + set hash** | `encode.rs`, `row_digest.rs`, `lthash.rs` (LtHash + sorted-digest) | unit + property + `#[pg_test]` order/parallel/types |
| **M2 — Generated SQL + two-node compare** | `sqlgen.rs`, sync `transport`, `compare_table` | two-node clean/missing/extra/differs; EXPLAIN shows index scans |
| **M3 — Contract** | `contract/pglogical.rs` (mask/column/filter/sync/sequence) | row-filter, column-list, insert-only, no-delete, mid-sync, sequence scenarios |
| **M4 — Vector fence + recheck** | `fence.rs` | post-fence UPDATE/DELETE cleared; live-load no false positive; bidirectional |
| **M5 — Merkle + localization** | `merkle.rs`, `plan.rs` | localize-to-key; keyless; partitioned |
| **M6 — Async fan-out + N-way** | async libpq | N-way + bidirectional fences |
| **M7 — Orchestration + catalogs** | `worker.rs`, `catalog.rs`, views, resumability, scheduling | resume-after-crash; throttle/pause |
| **M8 — Native + standby backends** | `contract/native.rs`, `contract/standby.rs` | native row-filter/pubactions; standby participant |
| **M9 — Repair** | `repair.rs` (origin-aware, locked, FK-ordered) | generate/apply/revalidate; multi-table FK; no loop |
| **M10 — Hardening + release** | security tiers, observability, cross-version, packaging | full matrix PG15–18 × 3 OSes |

Each milestone is independently shippable and fully tested before the next (no deferred work).

## 25. Open Questions and Future Work

- **Incremental validation** — re-validate only key ranges whose `pg_xact_commit_timestamp` watermark advanced since the last clean run, for cheap continuous assurance (catalog already records per-chunk verdicts and epochs).
- **Explicit sampling mode** — statistically-bounded partial validation for very large tables, with a *reported* confidence level (never silent scope reduction).
- **Slot-peek fence** — derive an exact provider fence LSN from a logical slot peek instead of `pg_current_wal_lsn()`, if a future need arises.
- **Conflict-history summaries** — conflict-history correlation is part of the catalog/API path; future work should add compact cause summaries and retention-policy controls for long-running fleets.

Reporting views (`runs`, `run_progress`, `table_results`, `chunk_results`, `divergences`, `sequence_results`, `schema_issues`) are thin layers over these tables.

## Appendix B: Worked Examples

### B.1 Validate a replication set across subscribers, nightly

```sql
-- On a provider/coordinator (requires shared_preload_libraries='pgl_validate' for scheduling).
INSERT INTO pgl_validate.schedule(name, cron, repset, options)
VALUES ('nightly-default', '0 2 * * *', 'default',
        '{"throttle_max_lag":"30s","chunk_target_rows":100000}');
```

### B.2 One-off validation of specific tables against named peers

```sql
SELECT pgl_validate.compare(
    tables    => ARRAY['public.orders','public.order_items']::regclass[],
    peers     => ARRAY['node_beta','node_gamma'],
    reference => 'node_alpha'
);                                              -- e.g. run_id 4217

SELECT verdict, reason FROM pgl_validate.table_result WHERE run_id = 4217;
SELECT * FROM pgl_validate.divergences(4217) WHERE status = 'confirmed';
SELECT * FROM pgl_validate.sequences(4217) WHERE NOT within_contract;
```

### B.3 CI gate (synchronous)

```sql
-- verdict ∈ match | differ | indeterminate | partial | approximate | degraded | skipped | error
-- A strict CI gate should require exactly 'match' and fail on anything else (a 'degraded' or
-- 'approximate' result means the comparison was not exact — see the validation-strength matrix).
SELECT (pgl_validate.compare_table('public.accounts')).verdict = 'match' AS in_sync;
```

### B.4 Inspect the planner-transparent SQL the engine will run

```sql
SELECT pgl_validate.plan_chunk_sql('public.orders', ARRAY['id'],
       lo => NULL, hi => NULL, cols => ARRAY['id','amount','status']);
-- => SELECT count(*), pgl_validate.lthash(
--           pgl_validate.row_digest('{2,1,1}'::int[], t."amount", t."id", t."status"))
--    FROM public.orders t WHERE true;
-- Note: enc[] is first; columns follow as VARIADIC "any" args sorted by name, never an ARRAY[...].
-- EXPLAIN that statement on any node to see the index/parallel plan.
```

### B.5 Origin-aware repair from the authoritative node

```sql
SELECT pgl_validate.generate_repair(4217, authoritative => 'node_alpha');   -- review first
-- Default local_only: relies on downstream forward_origins={} not re-forwarding the tagged
-- origin; downstream {all} subscriptions are refused before DML (§18.2).
SELECT pgl_validate.apply_repair(4217, authoritative => 'node_alpha',
                                 target => 'node_beta', confirm => 'node_beta',
                                 propagation => 'local_only');
```

## Appendix C: Row Digest and Set-Hash Specification

```
# Per-column canonical encoding (resolved at plan time, pinned for the run):
fn encode(col_type, value, opts) -> bytes:
    if value IS NULL: return                      # caller writes the 0x00 null tag instead
    if col_type == json and not opts.json_normalize: return text_out(value)   # exact
    if col_type == json and opts.json_normalize:    value := jsonb(value)
    if col_type in {float4,float8}:
        if value == -0.0 and not opts.signed_zero_distinct: value := 0.0
        if is_nan(value) and not opts.nan_distinct:         value := CANONICAL_NAN
    if has_stable_send(col_type, participant_versions): return typsend(col_type, value)
    if has_stable_text(col_type): return text_out_with_pinned_gucs(col_type, value)
    raise PreconditionError(UNSTABLE_TYPE, col_type)

# Row digest (256-bit). Args arrive ALREADY name-sorted from the generated SQL, positionally
# aligned with enc[]; row_digest hashes in arg order (it does NOT sort -- raw fcinfo cannot).
fn row_digest(enc: int[], cols: any[]) -> [u8;32]:   # cols is the VARIADIC "any" tail
    h := blake3()
    for i, c in enumerate(cols):                      # in the order received
        if c.value IS NULL: h.update([0x00])
        else:
            b := encode(c.type, c.value, mode = enc[i])
            h.update([0x01]); h.update(u32_le(len(b))); h.update(b)
    return h.finalize()[0..32]

# Chunk accumulator (LtHash; additive, parallel-safe, collision-resistant):
fn lthash_add(state[n], rd) :                     # n lanes of b bits, default n=1024,b=16
    lanes := blake3_xof(rd, n*b/8)                # expand row digest to n lanes
    for i in 0..n: state[i] := (state[i] + lane(lanes,i)) mod 2^b
fn lthash_combine(a,b): for i in 0..n: a[i] := (a[i]+b[i]) mod 2^b
# Two chunks equal on the fast path => multisets equal except w.p. <= LtHash bound; plus an independent count.

# Cryptographic confirmation for a localized (small) chunk.
# In SQL: pgl_validate.hash_digest_array(array_agg(rd ORDER BY rd))  -- ordering by the caller.
fn hash_digest_array(sorted_row_digests: bytea[]) -> [u8;32]:        # plain function, NOT an aggregate
    return blake3(concat(sorted_row_digests))    # equal IFF multisets equal, except w.p. ~= 2^-128
                                                 #   (256-bit hash => ~128-bit birthday bound;
                                                 #    blake3_512 => ~2^-256)
```

# Digest-stability confirmation (the §8.4 soundness core; uses only convergence + re-reads):
#   sample_A[node][k] := row_digest(k) at the bulk read
#   converge all edges to a fresh epoch E1 injected AFTER sample_A
#   sample_B[node][k] := row_digest(k) after convergence to E1
#   confirmed := (nodes still differ at k) AND (for all nodes: sample_A == sample_B)
#   cleared   := nodes now agree;   still_hot := some node's digest changed A->B (retry/indeterminate)

**Properties proven in the test suite:** order independence (any permutation ⇒ identical LtHash and `hash_digest_array`); duplicate sensitivity (an extra copy changes `count` and LtHash — XOR would not); GUC/locale independence; parallel-worker equivalence; the stated collision bounds (LtHash SIS ≥ 128-bit; `hash_digest_array` ≈ 2⁻¹²⁸ at 256-bit, ≈ 2⁻²⁵⁶ at 512-bit); and the §8.4 digest-stability confirmation soundness (a confirmed candidate cannot be a lag artifact).
